Have to rewrite the introduction.

If you've ever seen a data scientist or a programmer work, it may seem like they're speaking a different language.  A lot of them can just navigate programs better and faster than you can.  This is an acquired skill.  Programs, and even the entire Internet tends to follow the same pattern.  And by learning about that pattern we can enhance the way we retrieve data online, and we can then program a computer to find this information online in a similar way.   

So let's go back to browsing the web.


On viewing a single resource
Ok, so the url is `http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry`.  So it's close, not perfect.  One change is that ESPN uses `www.espn.com/nba/player` instead of 'players'.  Another change is that it looks like the key identifier is `/id/3975`, which is probably stephen curry's player id. 

An **id** is just a unique number (or list of characters) that can identify a specific item -- like a social security number. ESPN and almost all websites prefer to use IDs because multiple items could have the same name.  

So now that we know a little bit about how websites are organized, we can pick up on the pattern that any specific website uses!
